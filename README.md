# flower-catalogue
A flower catalogue SPA where users can login & register, create, edit & delete entries. They also have a profile page with their own catalogue of what they've created so far

## Purpose
Practice things learned in SoftUni JS Apps course & learn how to use a BaaS like Firebase

## TBC with:
notifications, error handling, likes, tests, maybe comments, maybe pagination (will have to rewrite the http requests to add according to Firebase's rules)


will add a link when deployed
